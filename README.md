Python files include different functions for risk measurements of options and stocks positions as well as option pricing and credit default risk models 

-> risk1: BS model, BS delta, Expected shortfall (ES), Value at Risk (p-VaR)

-> risk2: GBM for 1 stock and 2 stock port (mu and sigma calibration), Parametric VaR, Historical VaR, Historical parameter calibration, Exponential weightening

-> risk3: Drift and volatility calibration (2, 5 and 10 year window and exponential average) for GBM, hazard rate modeling (constant - exponentially distributed and variable), normal distributed Portfolios and GBM port VaR and ES estimation

-> risk4: Merton Model for credit default risk, single stocks GBM VaR and ES compared to GBM Portfolio VaR and ES (5 year drift and volatility calibration)

-> risk5:
